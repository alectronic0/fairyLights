# fairyLights

The exercise is to write a controller for a length of fairy lights.  There are 20 fairy lights in alternating colours red, green and white that can be independently turned on and off. 
The controller is a java program that accepts (as a command line parameter) the name of a sequencing algorithm for turning the lights on and off.  When launched, the program will execute the requested sequencing algorithm in a permanent loop until it the program is terminated.
